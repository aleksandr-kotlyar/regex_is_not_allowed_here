Here is a price string converter. Wihout regex.

Enjoy!

I have made this project for my friend, collegue and mentor. To show him more documented and supportable way to write parsings.

So, take this regex shit out from your code `"(^[-+\\d]*\\d*[,.\\d]\\d*)"`, forever. Right now.

REGEX IS NOT ALLOWED HERE.
